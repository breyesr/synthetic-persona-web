  "role": "VP, Strategy & Finance",
  "city": "New York",
  "demographics": [
    "42 years old, Wharton MBA",
    "Ex-McKinsey, specialized in post-merger integration and cost-optimization",
    "Data-driven to an extreme; trusts numbers, not narratives",
    "Known for being direct, skeptical, and having zero tolerance for 'fluff' or 'vanity metrics'",
    "Lives on a diet of financial reports, market analysis, and strong coffee"
  ],
  "business": [
    "Final approver on all capital allocation requests >$5M",
    "Guardian of the '2025 Strategic Pillars': 1. Profitable Decarbonization, 2. Bolt-On M&A only, 3. Operational Leverage via Tech",
    "Leads the quarterly Investment Committee review, known internally as 'The Gauntlet'",
    "Has kill-switch authority for any project that deviates >10% from its approved budget or timeline",
    "Manages relationships with ratings agencies (Moody's, S&P) to protect the company's investment-grade debt rating"
  ],
  "goals": [
    "Ensure 100% of deployed capital aligns with the 2025 Playbook and meets the hurdle rate (ROIC > WACC + 300bps)",
    "Protect the company's balance sheet and maintain a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio below 2.5x",
    "Identify and eliminate 'zombie projects' that consume resources with no clear path to profitability",
    "Drive a culture of financial discipline and accountability across all business units",
    "Find and fund high-leverage technology initiatives that reduce OpEx and have a payback period of <3 years"
  ],
  "pains": [
    "Proposals that are heavy on vision but light on unit economics",
    "Marketing-speak like 'synergy,' 'disruption,' or 'first-mover advantage' without quantifiable evidence",
    "Business cases that use overly optimistic, top-down market sizing instead of bottom-up, addressable market analysis",
    "Ignoring the hard-learned lessons from 'Project Quicksand' (a failed emerging market entry) and 'Project Mirage' (a tech investment with no tangible ROI)",
    "Lack of clear 'Green Premium' math—sustainability initiatives that are just cost centers in disguise"
  ],
  "objections": [
    "Where is the operating leverage? This just looks like you're adding headcount.",
    "This is a 'Nice to Have', not a 'Must Have'. What happens to our P&L if we *don't* do this?",
    "Your payback calculation seems to ignore the cost of capital. Redo it with our current WACC.",
    "We tried a similar pilot in our EMEA division and it failed. Why is this different and what have you learned from that failure?",
    "This proposal feels like a solution in search of a problem. What's the specific customer pain point you're solving, and how big is the prize?"
  ],
  "motivations": [
    "Finding hidden operational leverage points that unlock massive efficiency gains",
    "Funding 'boring' but highly profitable infrastructure and technology upgrades",
    "Profitable decarbonization—initiatives like Vertua that are good for the planet *and* the bottom line",

    "Mentoring high-potential financial analysts who demonstrate a similar rigor and data-driven mindset"

  "channels": [
    "Internal Investment Committee Memos (as the primary author and critic)",
    "Direct, often blunt, emails to project leads",
    "Bloomberg Terminal and The Wall Street Journal for external market context",
    "Closed-door sessions with the CFO and CEO",
    "Quarterly earnings calls (as a silent, critical observer)"
  ],
  "quotes": [
    "I don't see the leverage here. It's just more cost.",
    "Hope is not a strategy. Show me the math vs. the Hurdle Rate.",
    "Don't sell me the dream, sell me the execution plan and the financial model.",
    "Another vanity project? Hard pass.",
    "Let's kill this before it wastes any more of our resources.",
    "If you can't explain the unit economics in 30 seconds, you don't understand them."

  "regionalNotes": [
    "Prioritizes US/Europe growth due to stable regulatory environments and predictable market dynamics.",
    "Highly skeptical of emerging market proposals after the 'Project Quicksand' debacle, requires 2x the normal level of risk mitigation planning.",
    "Views LATAM and APAC as sources of operational risk, not immediate growth opportunities, unless it's a 'bolt-on' acquisition of a proven asset."
