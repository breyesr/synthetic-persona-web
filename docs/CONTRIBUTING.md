Contributing to Synthetic Persona Web

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you set up your environment, understand the workflow, and follow our standards.

â¸»

ðŸ›  Development Setup

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/breyesr/synthetic-persona-web.git
cd synthetic-persona-web

2. Install Dependencies

npm install

3. Run Locally

PORT=3001 npm run dev

Then open http://localhost:3001

4. Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file in the root of the project:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

Required:
  â€¢ OPENAI_API_KEY â†’ Needed for persona Q&A and actionable insights. Without it, the app falls back to deterministic stubs.

Optional:
  â€¢ PORT â†’ Defaults to 3000; override with your preferred port.
  â€¢ Next.js Telemetry can be disabled: npx next telemetry disable

5. Code Standards
  â€¢ Language: TypeScript + React (Next.js App Router)
  â€¢ Style: ESLint + Prettier enforced.
  â€¢ No any types unless explicitly justified.
  â€¢ Components follow functional React with hooks.

6. Git Workflow
  â€¢ Default branch: main (production)
  â€¢ Development branch: develop
  â€¢ Feature branches: feat/<short-description>
  â€¢ Bugfix branches: fix/<short-description>

Workflow:

git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature

Open a PR into develop. Once approved, merges to main will auto-deploy to Vercel.

7. Commit Conventions

Follow Conventional Commits:
  â€¢ feat: â€“ new feature
  â€¢ fix: â€“ bug fix
  â€¢ docs: â€“ documentation only changes
  â€¢ refactor: â€“ code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  â€¢ chore: â€“ maintenance tasks

Example:

git commit -m "feat(scorecard): improve CPL calculation logic"

8. Testing

Currently lightweight:
  â€¢ Manual testing via local dev.
  â€¢ Use starter questions in the IntakeForm to verify persona Q&A changes.
  â€¢ Ensure outputs remain coherent (Scorecard â†’ Q&A â†’ Insights).

9. Project Structure

src/
 â”œâ”€ app/

 â””â”€ prompts/                    # Prompt definitions

10. Deployment
  â€¢ Hosted on Vercel.
  â€¢ Every push to main triggers a production build.
  â€¢ Every PR deploys to a Vercel preview URL.

11. Documentation
  â€¢ /docs/README.md â†’ Project overview & quickstart.
  â€¢ /docs/architecture.md â†’ High-level system architecture.
  â€¢ /docs/contributing.md (this file) â†’ Development guide.

12. How to Contribute
  1.  Fork the repo & create a branch.
  2.  Make your changes.
  3.  Run locally & test thoroughly.
  4.  Commit using Conventional Commit message.
  5.  Open a PR into develop.

âœ¨ Notes for Contributors
  â€¢ Goal of MVP:
  â€¢ Take minimal user inputs.
  â€¢ Return: Scorecard (numbers), Persona Q&A (human voice), Insights (actions).
  â€¢ LLM dependency: OpenAI is used, but fallback stubs keep the app working offline.
  â€¢ Keep it simple: Always prefer clarity in Spanish for end-user outputs.

Happy coding ðŸš€
